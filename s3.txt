S3 - Simple Storage Service, provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable, flat object storage.
- Object-based storage:
--- Key
--- Value
--- Version ID
--- Metadata
--- Subresources:
--- --- Access Control Lists
--- --- Torrent
- Unlimited storage
- Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 Terrabytes
- Files stored in buckets (basically just folders/logical separation)
- Bucket names have to be unique globally
- Successful upload will receive HTTP200 code
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time)
- Built for 99.99% availability
- Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (unlikely to ever lose a file)
- Tiered storage available
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies


S3 Storage Tiers
- S3 Standard:
--- 99.99% available, 99.999999999% durable
- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed):
--- Data that is accessed less often, but requires rapid access. Lower fee than S3 but charged retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone IA:
--- Lower-cost option for IA but doesn't require multiple AZ resiliance
- Glacier:
--- Super cheap, used for archival only. Retrieval time takes 3-5 hours


S3 Charges
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing (tags)
- Data Transfer Pricing (cross-region replication)
- Transfer Accelleration - fast transfers over long distances using CloudFront


S3 Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (even if you delete an object)
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses MFA, can be used to provide additional layer of security


S3 Cross Region Replication
- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically, all new and updated files will be replicated automatically
- You cannot replicate multiple buckets or daisy chain replication
- Delete markers are replicated
- Deleted individual versions or markers will not be replicated


S3 Lifecycle Management
- Can be used with versioning
- Can be applied to current and previous versions
- Transition to IA after 30 days is possible
- Archive to Glacier after 30 days is possible
- Can permanently delete after N days


S3 Security & Encryption
- All newly created buckets are private by default
- You can setup access control for buckets using bucket policies and ACL
- Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log requests made to the bucket.
- Methods of Encryption
--- In Transit
--- --- SSL/TLS
--- At Rest
--- --- Server Side
--- --- --- S3 Manged Keys SSE-S3
--- --- --- AWS Key Management Service, Manged Keys SSE-KMS
--- --- --- Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys SSE-C
--- --- Client Side Encryption


S3 Transfer Accelleration
- Uses CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate yoru uploads to S3

S3 Static Website Hosting
- [bucketname].s3-website-[region].amazonaws.com



S3 Exam Tips
- S3 is object-based
- Files can be 0B to 5TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets
- Universal namespace, names must be unique
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
--- Immediately able to read object
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (take time to propogate)
--- If you update object and then try to read you may get the old object
- Writing to S3 returns HTTP200 for successful write
- Loading files is faster when multipwart upload is enabled

- Storage Tiers
--- S3 Standard
--- --- 99.99 available, 99.999999999 durable, designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently
--- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)
--- --- Accessed less frequently, requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3 but charged for retrieval.
--- S3 One Zone IA
--- --- Want lower-cost for infrequent data but doesn't require multiple AZ resiliency
--- Glacier
--- --- Cheap, used for archival only. 3-5 hour retrieval time

- Core Fundamentals of S3:
--- Key
--- Value
--- Version ID
--- Metadata
--- Access Control Lists

- Versioning
---  Objected based storage (files only, not OS or db)
---  All versionf of object are stored, writes and deletes
---  Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled
---  Integrates with Lifecycle rules
---  Versioning's MFA Delete capability can be used to provide additional layer of security
---  Cross Region Replication, requires versioning on source and destination buckets

- Lifecycle Management
--- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
--- Can be applied to current/previous versions
--- Actions that can be done:
--- --- Transition to Standard S3 IA after 30 days
--- --- Archive to Glacier after 30 days
--- --- Permanently Delete

- CloudFront
--- Edge Location - location where content will be cached
--- Origin - Origin of all files that CDN will distribute
--- Distribution - name given to CDN which consists of collection of Edge Locations
--- --- Web Distribution - typically used for websites
--- --- RTMP Distributions - media streaming/flash files
--- Edge locations are not just read only, you can write to them too
--- Objects are cached for life of TTL (default 24 hours)

- Securing Buckets
--- Newly created buckets are private by default
--- You can setup access control using:
--- --- Bucket Policies
--- --- Access Control Lists
--- Buckets can be configured to create access logs

- Encryption
--- In Transit
--- --- SSL/TLS
--- At Rest
--- --- Server Side Encryption
--- --- --- S3 Manged Keys SSE-S3
--- --- --- AWS Key Management Service, Manged Keys SSE-KMS
--- --- --- Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys SSE-C
- Storage Gateways
--- File Gateway - flat files, directly on S3
--- Volume Gateway
--- --- Stored Volumes - Entire dataset stored on site, async backed up to S3
--- --- Cached Volumes - Entire dataset stored in S3, most recent data stored onsite
--- Gateway Virtual Tape Library (VTL) - Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam, etc.

- Snowball
--- Import to S3 or Export from S3
--- Snowball
--- --- 80TB, no compute
--- Snowball Edge
--- --- 100TB, has compute
--- Snowmobile
--- --- 100PB, semi-truck

- S3 Transferion Accelleration
--- Speed up transfers to S3 using S3 transfer acceleration. Costs extra, great impact for people in distant locations.

- S3 Static websites
- Serverless
- Cheap, scales automatically
- Static only, no compute
