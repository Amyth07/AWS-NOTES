Placement Groups:
- Only certain types of instances can be launched in placement group (compute, GPU, Memory, Storage)
- AWS recommends homogenous instances
- Can't merge placement Groups
- Can't move existing instance into a palcement group
- Can create AMI from instance and launch that into placement group

Clustered Placement Group:
- Grouping of instances within a single AZ. Recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both
- Can't spread multiple AZ

Spread Placement Group:
- Group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware. Recommended for applications that have small number of critical instances that should be kept separte from each other
- Can spread over multiple AZ
