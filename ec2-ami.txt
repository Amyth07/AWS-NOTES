EBS Vs Instance Store
- All AMI's are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance Store
- EBS Volumes:
--- The root devbice for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
- Instance Store Volumes:
--- The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume cretaed from a template stored in Amazon S3
--- Sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
--- If host fails, you lose your data
- Only EBS backed instances can be stopped
- Both instances types can be rebooted
- By default, ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, but with EBS volumes you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
