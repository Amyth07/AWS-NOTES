VPC
- Logically isloated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- Virtual Data Center in the cloud
- Amazon provides you a default VPC in every region when you create your account
- Can create hardware VPN between corporate datacenter and your VPC, make AWS your extension

What can be done:
- Launch instances into sugnet of choice
- Assign custom IP address range to each subnet
- Configure route tables between subnets
- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC, one per VPC
- Better security control over AWS resources
- Instance security groups
- Subnet Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Default VPC Vs. Custom VPC
- Default VPC is user friendly, allows you to immediately deply
- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet
- Each EC2 instance has public and private IP address

VPC Peering
- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP Addresses
- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in same account
- Peering is in star configuration: 1 central VPC peer with 4 others---no transitive peering

Exam Tips
- Think of VPC as logical datacenter in AWS
- Consists of IGW's (or virtual private gateways), route tables, NACL's, Subnets, Security Groups
- 1 subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are stateful; NACL's are Stateless
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING

- NAT Instances
  - When creating a NAT instance, disable source/destination check on the instance
  - NAT instances must be in a public subnet
  - There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance for this to work
  - The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the instance size
  - You can create HA using:
    - Autoscaling Groups
    - Multiple subnets in different AZs
    - Script to automate failover
  - Behind Security groups

- NAT gateways
  - Preferred by the enterprise
  - Scale automatically up to 10Gbps
  - No need to patch
  - Not associated with security groups
  - Automatically assigned a public ip address
  - Remember to update route tables and point to NAT Gateways
  - No need to disable source/destination checks
  - More secure than a NAT instance

- Network ACL's
  - VPC automatically comes with default network ACL and by default allows all in/outbound traffic
  - You can create custom network ACL's. By default each network ACL denies all in/outbound traffic
  - each subnet in VPC must be associated with a network ACL, uses default ACL by default
  - You can associate network ACL with multiple subnets, however subnet can only associate with one ACL at a time
  - Adding subnet to a second ACL will automatically remove it from the previous ACL
  - network ACL contains numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order, starting with lowest number
  - network ACL always have separate inbound and outbound rules
  - network ACL's are stateless
